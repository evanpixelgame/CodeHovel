add settings button
take away div from the top action bar right side buttons
maybe try linking header and footer colors and other symmetries
or in settings give symmetry options
write out full read me on how the code works and how to use it in a project, include code examples
add on hover effects

have the info button and the instructions for it instead say Tutorial on Use: and then have a list of links of stuff like the select bar, the buttons, etc,
maybe even have a mini version of the app that users can click to represent the area on the app they need help working
when clicked on a specific thing, will reference to the relevant section in the README 

add a suggested pallet to the color picker


FOR PORTFOLIO:D 
for portfolio:

ADD A BUNCH OF TINY projects and apps all throughout to demonstrate the abilities without them having to click any links
add things like the customizer and others and put them in clever places in the site and make them do interesting things while being neatly done to show skill
