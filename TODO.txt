add robot.txt for SEO and other SEO things


add some sort of fonts library for more font selection options

add additional objects to demonstrate secondary and tertriary color properties like adding more colored things to main and/or dynamically coloring the svg
  -also add stuff with the secondary font color

-change the svg of the profile image background and give bg more options

make it so the position slides can change positioning to fixed to move outside their container and then do some logic to make the other elements reassemble with appropriate spacing

Turn ContextProvider's defaultThemeProperties into an object with different nested objects with those properties, so do defaultThemeProperties{darkDefault: {}, lightDefault: {}} etc.
This will make is so that the object differences works from a different starting theme (can just do ...props and then modify any different features for the different default objects after dark)

add settings button
-add option to link symmetries
--in the symmetry options, can check box which controls you want to always stay linked

maybe try linking header and footer colors and other symmetries
or in settings give symmetry options
write out full read me on how the code works and how to use it in a project, include code examples

have the info button and the instructions for it instead say Tutorial on Use: and then have a list of links of stuff like the select bar, the buttons, etc,
maybe even have a mini version of the app that users can click to represent the area on the app they need help working
when clicked on a specific thing, will reference to the relevant section in the README 

add a suggested pallet to the color picker


FOR PORTFOLIO:D 
for portfolio:

ADD A BUNCH OF TINY projects and apps all throughout to demonstrate the abilities without them having to click any links
add things like the customizer and others and put them in clever places in the site and make them do interesting things while being neatly done to show skills
